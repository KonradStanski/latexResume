## How To Use:
- Make sure to have pdflatex + biber installed

- Run `./monitor.sh` to get automatic recompilation and cleaning whenever you save
- Open the pdf in evince or similar for automatic refreshing upon save


## Context/Howto
- The resume.tex file contains content for your header aswell as your main bar on the left
- The sidebar.tex file contains content that apears in the right sidebar
- You can change the margins (I have obnoxiously large ones) in the 5th line of resume.tex
- custom functions are defined in the altacv.cls file
